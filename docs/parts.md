# Parts used in the project

### Controller: Raspberry Pi Pico
Purchased at: https://amperka.ru\
Price: 890 руб.\
Notes: This was chosen due to my general fondness of Raspberries, and also because it was a small controller that had a bunch of IO. Main problem I encountered with this board was me not knowing that soldering it would be quite challanging and buying one without legs. I also have to balance power due to Wi-Fi module and LEDs having theoretical current limit above Pico's 300mA

### Roof LED: Generic RGB one
Purchased at: https://amperka.ru\
Price: 80 руб.\
Notes: RGB was chosen as a way to provide a simple indicator that wouldn't require activating e-ink sign. It also lets me change it between 13th Doctor's blue light and previous Doctors' white one.

### Interior LED: Generic white one
Purchased at: https://amperka.ru\
Price: 80 руб. for a 4 pack\
Notes: Chose plain white due to not needing any fancy effects inside the TARDIS (E-Ink and roof LED already provide information and fun), so this was just a simple addition for realism.

### Wi-Fi module: ESP8266 (ESP-01)
Purchased at: https://amperka.ru\
Price: 660 руб.\
Notes: Pico W was unavailable, so I had to add a dedicated Wi-Fi module. Draws up to 220mA and can easily use 70mA, so requires power management (turning off LEDs) to not overload system during usage. Needed for connecting to companion service for things like weather.

### E-Ink sign: 1.54" WaveShare monochrome (Assembled kit)
Purchased at: https://amperka.ru\
Price: 1740 руб.\
Notes: I wanted to use an e-ink screen the second I realised I could fit one in the TARDIS's sign. This is used for weather and fun things (Like the Master's HAHAHAHAHA sign), however its idle state is the normal police box sign. Draws almost no power so doesn't have to be off.

### Other parts
I also bought a bunch of wires, a breadboard and pins for soldering Pi Pico. For small misc parts the budget did not exceed 1000 руб. for everything. Almost all of them were bought on https://amperka.ru
