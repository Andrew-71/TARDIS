# TARDIS

This repository contains code, notes and other information related to my model TARDIS.

## File structure:
`/code` - Source for code that runs on the Pico inside the TARDIS and services that it needs.
`/models` - 3D and 2D models for the TARDIS's shell
`/docs` - Documentation that specifies how the project was made and how it can be improved further\

The project is in early stages of development and *everything* is a subject to change.
